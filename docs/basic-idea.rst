The Idea
------------------
All discounts and Deals at one place
************************************
`There are many sites on the net which show all the discounts from eretailers in one place. Make them searchable and accessible to price conscious consumers who like deals and discounts. But the same kind of service is not available for the offline or in-store deals and discounts. I guess the following are the reasons`

sample sites

- `cashkaro => all discounts <http://cashkaro.com>`_
- `findyogi => only for mobiles <http://findyogi.com>`_


online deals advantage
**********************
  1. online retailers provide apis. so easy to get data.
  2. Online retailers pay referral bonus

offline deals disadvantages
***************************
  1. too many interfaces and no api support.
  2. difficult to earn referral bonus.
